# Additional things I would have done
## 1. Add the Complete CRUD to recipes and grocery items.
I would have added edit/delete options to the recipes and groceries.

## 2. Add the advanced searching and filtering to the recipes.
At the moment user can only see 3 searches where recipes and groceries are fetched from the ODA's api. I would have added more options for filtering the recipes e.g(cooking time),
and more options for groceries e.g, price filter, availability. etc.

## 3. Payment Integration
I could have added payment integration when user checkouts.

## 4. Control the number of groceries while selection.
Allow user to select one grocery item twice or thrice, or decrement this count.
